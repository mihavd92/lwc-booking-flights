**The Booking Flights App** is my final project for the Salesforce course. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of my skills and knowledge in Salesforce development, showcasing my ability to utilize Apex for server-side logic and Lightning Web Components (LWC) for the user interface. 

The project encompasses the implementation of a flight booking app for "Force Airlines," focusing on code optimization, adherence to best practices, and showcasing problem-solving and decision-making skills.
